* Summary

This repo contains a small collection of vanilla web components for design token development. Rendering tokens generated
by [[https://github.com/quarksuite/core][QuarkSuite Core]] is its main purpose, but they can be used standalone with equivalent data.

The project is currently in its concept stage as I build the elements out and consider exactly what data to render and
/how/ it ought to render. Expect more work in this space as Core v2 is now done and stable.
