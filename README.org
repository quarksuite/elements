* Summary

This repo contains vanilla web components for design token development. The main
purpose is rendering QuarkSuite data, but they also have limited assignment and
destructuring powers for the QuarkSuite DSL to hook into or for standalone use.

As this is the initial development phase and very much a proof of concept,
you're already finished with the README for now.
